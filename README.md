ENOCH: ENabling On-body network Contention Handling

Abstract

Body area networking is an important segment of the wireless landscape, connecting a growing range of devices such as fitness trackers and smart watches using short range wireless links. However, conventional wireless technologies such as BLE and ANT provide poor support for low-latency applications such as haptic feedback due to their dependence upon duty-cycling to maintain acceptable power consumption. Recent physical-layer design efforts introduce a low-power alternative by establishing capacitively coupled communication through the human body. This mitigates duty-cycling requirements, but results in channel access times similar to those found in more conven- tional wireless networks, failing to provide adequate latency guarantees even for modestly sized networks of several devices. We address this problem by introducing ENOCH, an ultra-low power 12 MHz receiver that relies on capacitive coupling to establish a fieldbus-like through-body network. ENOCH delivers a sub-Î¼W receiver, 10 kbps link-layer throughput, traffic prioritisation, 97% baseline reliability and 7 ms latency regardless of contention for the channel. Our design is simple and uses only commercial off- the-shelf components. As it requires neither large antennas nor crystal oscillators, we believe that further miniaturization beyond the current 1 cm2 hardware/software prototype is possible.
